//
* If you are enrolled in the class you should be receiving course emails. If
you would like to sign up for the email list, here is the link:
//
[.spelling_exception]#https://www.ops-class.org/mailman/listinfo/ub#
//
* Syllabus is link:/courses/buffalo/CSE421_Spring2017/[online and updated].
//
* link:/slides/[Videos] are up. (Sorry they're blurry--we'll fix that starting
* today.)
//
* Recitations will start next week.
//
* The add/drop deadline is *next Monday February 6th.*
//
** You still have time to examine the assignments and decide if this course is
right for you right now.

[.nooutline]
== ASST0

[.slider]
//
* link:/asst/0/[ASST0] is "due" today.
//
* If you are not done, please come by office hours this afternoon to finish
up.
//
* Recitations next week will cover link:/asst/1/[ASST1].

[.nooutline]
== Office Hours Scheduling

[.slider]
//
* A preliminary schedule will be up this evening.
//
* Here's the algorithm we're going to use:
//
** If you can attend at least four office hours, then stop.
//
** If not, determine some extra hours that you would like to attend.
//
** We will distribute a form for suggesting extra office hours.
//
** Based on your suggestions we will add extra office hours.

[.nooutline]
== Office Hours Protocol

[.slider]
//
* *Location*&mdash;we're going to try and use the first floor lounge this
year.
//
We'll see how that goes.
//
* Please be respectful of the TAs and ninjas:
//
[.slider]
//
** Bother them relentlessly _during_ office hours...
//
** and leave them alone _outside of_ office hours.

[.nooutline]
== Cold Calling

[.slider]
//
* I will cold call students during class, possibly using a tool integrate with
the slides.
//
* Cold calling is *not* designed to make anyone uncomfortable! Feel free to
pass or say "I don't know."

== Operating System Abstractions

.Abstractions _simplify application design_ by:
//
[.slider]
//
* *hiding undesirable properties*,
//
* *adding new capabilities*, and
//
* *organizing information*.

[.slide]
--
Abstractions provide an [.slide]*interface* to application programmers that
separates [.slide]*policy*&mdash;what the interface commits to accomplishing--from
[.slide]*mechanism*&mdash;how the interface is implemented.
--

== Example Abstraction: File

.What *undesirable properties* do file systems hide?
//
[.slider]
//
* Disks are slow!
//
* Chunks of storage are actually distributed all over the disk.
//
* Disk storage may fail!

.What *new capabilities* do files add?
//
[.slider]
//
* Growth and shrinking.
//
* Organization into directories.

.What *information* do files help organize?
//
[.slider]
//
* Ownership and permissions.
//
* Access time, modification time, type, etc.

== Preview of Coming Abstractions

[.slider]
//
* *Threads* abstract the CPU.
//
* *Address spaces* abstract memory.
//
* *Files* abstract the disk.
//
* We will return to these abstractions. We are starting with an
organizing principle.

== The Process

[.slider]
.*Processes are the most fundamental operating system abstraction.*
* Processes organize information about other abstractions and represent
a single thing that the computer is "doing."
* You know processes as [.spelling_exception]#app(lication)s#.

== Organizing Information

Unlike threads, address spaces and files, processes are *not tied to a
hardware component*. Instead, they contain other abstractions.

[.small.slider]
.Processes contain:
* one or more *threads*,
* an *address space*, and
* zero or more open *file handles* representing *files*.

== Process as Protection Boundary

The operating system is responsible for isolating processes from each
other.

[.slider]
* What you do in your own process is your own business *but it shouldn't
be able to crash the machine or affect other processes*â€”or at least
processes started by other users.
* Thus: safe intra-process communication is *your* problem; safe
inter-process communication is an *operating system* problem.

== Intra-Process Communication: Easy

image::figures/intraprocess.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
* Communication between multiple threads in a process is usually
accomplished using *shared memory*.
* Threads within a process also share open file handles and both static
and dynamically-allocated global variables.
* Thread stacks and thus thread local variables are typically private.

== [.small]#Intra-Process Communication: Easy... Maybe#

image::figures/intraprocess.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* *Sharing data requires synchronization mechanisms to ensure
consistency.*
* We will return to this later.

== [.small]#Inter-Process Communication: Harder#

image::figures/interprocess.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
* A variety of mechanism exist to enable inter-process communication
(IPC), including shared files or sockets, exit codes, signals, pipes and
shared memory.
* All require coordination between the communicating processes.
* Most have semantics limiting the degree to which processes can
interfere with each other.
** A process can't just send a SIGKILL to any other process running on
the machine!

== $ wait # IPC: return codes

image::figures/returncode.svg[width="80%", role="expand"]

[.smaller.slider]
* Simplest and most-limited form of IPC.
* Allows processes to return a single int to the process that created
them.
* 0 typically indicates success; non-0, failure.
* Analogous to older computers that would transform a set of punch cards
into a "result."
* `bash` exposes return codes as `$?`:

== [.spelling_exception]#$ p | pes # IPC: pipes#

image::figures/pipes.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* Pipes create a producer-consumer buffer between two processes.
* Allows the output from one process to be used as the input to another.
* The operating system manages a queue for each pipe to accommodate
different input and output rates.
* Facilitates the canonical chaining together of small UNIX utilities to
do more sophisticated processing.
