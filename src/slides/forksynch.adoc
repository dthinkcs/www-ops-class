== Today

. Process life cycle:
** *Birth:* `fork()`
. Introduction to synchronization

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/1/[ASST1] Checkpoint

[.slider]
//
.At this point:
//
* If you have not started, *you're behind.*
//
* If you don't understand semaphores, *you're behind.*
//
* If you only have working locks, *you're behind.*
//
* If you have working CVs, you're a bit behind.
//
* If you have solved one of the synchronization problems or have working
reader-writer locks, you're OK.
//
* Keep in mind: *you need working locks and CVs for future assignments.*
//
** (The rest of the assignment is for points and won't hurt you as much in the
future.)

== Review: Updated Process Model

[.nooutline]
== Review: Levels of Indirection

[.slider]
* *Three* levels of indirection:
** file descriptor -> file handle.
** file handle -> file object.
** file object -> blocks on disk.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Sharing File State

[.slider]
.The additional level of indirection allows certain pieces of state to be shared separately.
* *File descriptors* are private to each process.
* *File handles* are private to each process but shared after process
creation.
** *File handles* store the current file *offset*, or the position in
the file that the next read will come from or write will go to. File
handles can be *deliberately* shared between two processes.
* *File objects* hold other file state and can be shared *transparently*
between many processes.

== Process Creation

Where do processes come from?

== `fork()` # create a new process

[.small.slider]
.`fork()` is the UNIX system call that creates a new process.
* `fork()` creates a new process that is a *copy* of the calling process.
* After `fork()` we refer to the caller as the *parent* and the
newly-created process as the *child*. This relationship enables certain
capabilities.

== `fork()` Semantics

[.slider]
* Generally `fork()` tries to make an *exact* copy of the calling process.
** Recent version of UNIX have relaxed this requirement and there are
now many flavors of `fork()` that copy different amounts of state and are
suitable for different purposes.
** For the purposes of this class, ignore them.
* Threads are a notable exception!

== `fork()` Against Threads

[.slider]
* Single-threaded `fork()` has reliable semantics because the *only
thread* the processes had is the one that called `fork()`.
** So nothing else is happening while we complete the system call.
* Multi-threaded `fork()` creates a host of problems that many systems
choose to ignore.
** Linux will only copy state for the thread that called `fork()`.

== Multi-Threaded `fork()`

[.slider]
.There are two major problems with multi-threaded `fork()`
. Another thread could be blocked in the middle of doing something
(uniprocessor systems), or
. another thread could be *actually* doing something (multiprocessor
systems).

This ends up being a big mess. Let's just copy the calling thread.

== `fork()`

[.slider]
. `fork()` copies one thread--the caller.
. `fork()` copies the address space.
. `fork()` copies the process file table.

== After `fork()`

[source,c]
----
returnCode = fork();
if (returnCode == 0) {
  # I am the child.
} else {
  # I am the parent.
}
----

[.smaller.slider]
* The child thread returns executing at the exact same point that its
parent called `fork()`.
** With one exception: `fork()` returns *twice*, the PID to the parent and
0 to the child.
* All contents of memory in the parent and child are identical.
* Both child and parent have the same files open at the same position.
** *But, since they are sharing file handles changes to the file
offset made by the parent/child will be reflected in the child/parent!*

== Pipes

[.slider]
.Chains of communicating processes can be created by exploiting the `pipe()` system call.
* `pipe()` creates an anonymous pipe object and returns a two file
descriptors: one for the read-only end, and the other for the write-only
end.
* Anything written to the write-only end of the pipe is immediately
available at the read-only end of the pipe.
* Pipe contents are buffered in memory.
* *Why is this useful?*

== IPC Using `fork()` and `pipe()`

. Before calling `fork()` the parent creates a pipe object by calling
pipe().
. Next, it calls `fork()`.
. After `fork()` the parent closes its copy of the read-only end and the
child closes its copy of the write-only end.
. Now the parent can pass information to the child.

== Issues with `fork()`

[.slider]
.Copying all that state is expensive!
* Especially when the next thing that a process frequently does is
start load a new binary which destroys most of the state `fork()` has
carefully copied!

[.slider]
.Several solutions to this problem:
* *Optimize existing semantics*: through copy-on-write, a clever
memory-management optimization we will discuss in several weeks.
* *Change the semantics*: `vfork()`, which will fail if the child does anything other than
immediately load a new executable.
** Does not copy the address space!

== Issues with `fork()`

.What if I don't want to copy all of my process state?
[.slider]
* `fork()` is now replaced by `clone()`, a more flexible primitive that
enables more control:
** over sharing, including sharing memory, and signal handlers,
** and over child execution, which begins at a function pointer passed
to the system call instead of resuming at the point where `fork()` was
called.
* Try `man clone` in your CSE421 VM.

== The Tree of Life

[.slider]
* `fork()` establishes a parent-child relationship between two process at
the point when each one is created.
* The `pstree` utility allows you to visualize these relationships.
